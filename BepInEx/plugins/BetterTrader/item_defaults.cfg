THIS FILE IS ONLY USED SO BetterTrader RECOGNIZES WHICH ITEMS SHOULD BE SOLD AND WHAT THEIR DEFAULT VALUES ARE FOR THE BepInEx Configuration Manager! ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES
NEED TO TAKE PLACE IN THE BepInEx/config/Menthus.bepinex.plugins.BetterTrader.cfg!!

Example1 AncientSeed
Example2 AncientSeed: stack = 1
Example3 AncientSeed: stack = 1 price = 30 tradeable = true

Default values MUST be in order if you decide to use them(e.g., stack, price, tradeable works, but price tradeable stack wouldn't).

If you enable WaitForDiscovery in BepInEx/config/Menthus.bepinex.plugins.BetterTrader.cfg, tradeable = true means the item will be sold by the trader after you've discovered the item.
If tradeable = false, then even after you've discovered the item it still won't be sold.
IF THE WaitForDiscovery OPTION ISN'T SHOWING UP, BE SURE TO RUN THE GAME AT LEAST ONCE WITH BetterTrader INSTALLED! THE OPTION WILL BE GENERATED ON STARTUP!
